# Installed into the virtual environment (.venv) during Dev Container setup.
# These tools are used across multiple workshop levels:
#
#   pytest  — Level 5 (test execution, TDD exercises)
#   flake8  — Level 5 (linting exercises)
#
# Note: All sample apps (Levels 1–6) use Python stdlib only.
# These are development/testing tools, not application dependencies.
